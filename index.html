It feels like Heaven on the inside
She's calling my name, and oh, it sounds nice
The way that you're dancing in the moonlight
I think I'm falling in love with all these big signs
Well, she said, "How you're feeling? Are you lost again?"
No, we don't need directions from you or your friends
We're speeding through the city 'cause you'll see the end
Just tell us where to go and we'll be there in ten
And she walks down
I noticed how she does it for real now
And she talks loud
She's telling me what I wanna hear now
Is it real now?
How do I know for sure?
She's always hanging with the wrong guys
She's caught up in lights, you know, the big kind
If I make it right, then we can leave time
I know I said it before, yeah, it just sounds nice
She said, "How you're feeling? Are you lost again?"
We don't need directions from you or your friends
We're speeding through the city 'cause you'll see the end
Just tell us where to go and we'll be there in ten
And she walks down
I noticed how she does it for real now (hey)
And she talks loud
She's telling me what I wanna hear now
Is it real now? Duh
She called me in the middle of a Sunday night
I'm falling just a little, baby, shit ain't right
She called me in the middle of a Sunday night
I'm falling just a little, baby, shit ain't right
Ah, ah-ah, ah
(Ooh) my baby
Ah, and she walks down
I noticed how she does it for real now (hey)
And she talks loud
She's telling me what I wanna hear now
Is it real now? Yeah
she called me in the middle of a Sunday night
I'm (and she walks down) falling just a little, baby, shit ain't right
She (and she walks down) called me in the middle of a Sunday night
I'm (and she walks down) falling just a little
Baby, shit ain't right (falling just a little bit)
(For so long)
